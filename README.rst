This web app is written entirely in C++ and utilizes the Empirical_ D3-wrapper to create an interactive visualization of different sorting algorithms.
This project is meant to serve as a demo for how the new D3-wrapper can be used with Empirical to create powerful web apps.

Along with `@elizabethcarney`_, `@amlalejini`_, and `@emilydolson`_ I worked on creating a C++ wrapper for D3.js_, a JavaScript library that allows for custom-made, interactive visualizations.   
We began the process of overhauling Empirical's web visualization support for use in the next version of Avida-ED_.

**For more information on what I did, see** `this blog post I wrote`_. 

**To checkout the live web app, see** `https://Oliver-BE.github.io/sorting-algorithms-d3`_.


Features
--------

* A slider to iterate through individual steps of a sorting algorithm
* A play button to speed through the remaining steps of a sorting algorithm 
* A shuffle button to randomize the data
* A card containing live statistics pertaining to the number of swaps a sorting algorithm has taken  
* Cool D3 transitions!
